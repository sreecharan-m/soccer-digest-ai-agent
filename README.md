# ⚽ Soccer Digest AI Agent

An autonomous, multi-agent AI system that curates a personalized daily soccer feed (news, transfer rumors, and viral memes) and delivers it straight to your inbox. 

Built with **CrewAI**, **LangChain**, and **OpenAI**, this project is designed to solve the "doomscrolling" problem, keeping you updated on your favorite teams without needing to manually hunt through social media feeds.

---

## 🧠 Architecture & Workflow

This project utilizes a multi-agent workflow to scrape, filter, format, and deliver content automatically:

1. **The Brain:** Powered by OpenAI (`gpt-4o-mini`) for cost-effective, high-speed reasoning.
2. **The Hunter Agent:** Acts as a digital scout. It uses custom tools built on the **Serper API** (`GoogleNewsSearchTool` and `GoogleImageSearchTool`) to fetch highly targeted breaking news and visual content based on specific team interests.
3. **The Curator Agent:** Acts as the newsletter editor. It takes the raw data, shuffles it to interleave text and images (preventing clumping), and compiles it into a clean, visual HTML format.
4. **The Delivery Pipeline:** Uses Python's built-in `smtplib` and Gmail SMTP to safely blast the final compiled HTML to a list of recipients. 
5. **The Infrastructure:** Fully automated via **GitHub Actions**, running unattended on a daily cron schedule.

## 🚀 Getting Started (Local Setup)

Want to run this locally or customize it for your own interests? Follow these step-by-step instructions.

### 1. Prerequisites
You will need a few API keys and passwords to run the agent:
* **OpenAI API Key:** For the agent's reasoning engine. Get it at [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/).
* **Serper API Key:** For the Google News and Google Image search tools. Get it at [Serper.dev](https://serper.dev/) (provides 2,500 free queries).
* **Gmail App Password:** To send the emails securely without exposing your real password. 
  * *How to get it:* Go to your Google Account -> Security -> 2-Step Verification -> App Passwords -> Create a new app password.

### 2. Installation
Clone the repository and set up your Python environment (Python 3.10+ recommended).

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/soccer-digest-ai-agent.git](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/soccer-digest-ai-agent.git)
cd soccer-digest-ai-agent

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv env

# Activate the environment
# On Windows:
env\Scripts\activate
# On Mac/Linux:
source env/bin/activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory of the project. Copy the template below and add your actual credentials.

```bash
# --- API Keys ---
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-YourOpenAIKeyHere...
SERPER_API_KEY=YourSerperKeyHere...

# --- Email Configuration ---
# The Gmail account that will SEND the email
EMAIL_SENDER=your.bot.email@gmail.com
# The 16-character App Password generated by Google (no spaces)
EMAIL_PASSWORD=abcdefghijklmnop
# Comma-separated list of people who will RECEIVE the email
EMAIL_RECIPIENTS=you@gmail.com,yourfriend@yahoo.com
```

### 4. Run the Agent
Once your environment is active and your .env file is saved, execute the main script:

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## 🚀 Automated Deployment

```bash
To automate your bot:

Push this code to your own GitHub repository.

Go to your repository Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions.

Under Repository secrets, click New repository secret.

Add your 4 environment variables exactly as they are named in your .env file:

OPENAI_API_KEY

SERPER_API_KEY

EMAIL_SENDER

EMAIL_PASSWORD

EMAIL_RECIPIENTS (Optional, depending on your setup)

Note: Make sure you create individual Repository Secrets for each variable. Do not create a single secret named "ENV".

Once saved, the script will automatically wake up and email you every day at the time specified in the cron schedule!
```

## 🛠️ Customization Guide

```bash
1. Change the Teams / Interests
Open src/main.py and locate the interests variable inside the main() function. Change the string to reflect your favorite clubs, leagues, or players. The Hunter agent uses this exact string to guide its searches.

Python
# src/main.py
interests = "Arsenal, Lamine Yamal, Champions League, Football Memes"
2. Change the Agent Behavior
Want the Curator to be more sarcastic? Want the Hunter to focus only on transfer news? Open src/agents.py and modify the backstory and goal prompts.

Python
# src/agents.py -> curator_agent()
backstory=(
    "You are a chaotic social media editor. "
    "You MUST interleave the content: [Image] -> [News] -> [Image]. "
    "Add a sarcastic comment below every piece of news."
)
3. Change the Output Volume (Tasks)
Open src/tasks.py to dictate exactly how many items the agents should fetch. If you want a longer email, explicitly increase the required count in the prompt.

Python
# src/tasks.py -> fetch_trends()
description=(
    f"1. EXECUTE 'Google News Search' for: {interests}. Collect 10 text items. "
    f"2. EXECUTE 'Google Image Search' for: {interests}. Collect 10 visual items. "
    "3. CRITICAL: You MUST run BOTH tools. Do not stop after the news search. "
)
4. Change the Delivery Time
Open .github/workflows/daily_digest.yml and modify the cron schedule. The default 0 12 * * * runs at 12:00 PM UTC. You can use crontab.guru to calculate your preferred timezone.

YAML
on:
  schedule:
    # Runs at 12:00 UTC every day
    - cron: '0 12 * * *'
```

## Repurpose for a Different Usecase

```bash
Because the tools are general-purpose Google Search connectors, you can turn this into a completely different bot just by changing the interests string and slightly tweaking the agent prompts. Examples:

📈 Stock Market / Fintech Tracker

🏎️ F1 Race Weekend Digest

✈️ Aviation Industry News Bot
```
